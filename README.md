PvPManager Premium
If you have been using PvPManager for a long time you probably know how much it improved since earlier versions, it was the first plugin i ever released on bukkit, many years ago.

I really appreciate it if you have been using my plugin over the years, even if there were times where I was less active. If you wish to support my work, there is a premium version of PvPManager. Think of it as a fork of this version but with improved performance and many extra features and improvements.

If you don't make a profit from your server, this free version is NOT abandoned and will keep receiving updates but don't hesitate to throw me a nice review, it means a lot more than you think!â€‹
